/*This program handles the encoding and decoding of a message, inputed in input.txt, using the rotation cypher or substitution cypher, the message is outputed to stdout and the file output.txt. Mode selection is achieved through selecting the mode in the file setup.txt. The encoding is done using a key inputed by the user through the file setup.txt. The message can be decoded with or without a key being provided, if the key used to encode the message is known it is inputed by the user through the file setup.txt.*/

/*The File layout for setup.txt is below, incase of accidental deletion this can be copied to a file called setup.txt, an input.txt and output.txt file will also need to be created, instructions on how to use these are given in NOTES in setup.txt

Mode select

Rotation Modes
1: Encode using rotation cypher with a chosen key
2: Decode using rotation cypher with a known key
3: Decode using rotation cypher with an unknown key

Substitution Modes
4: Encode using substitution cypher with a chosen key
5: Decode using substitution cypher with a known key
6: Decode using substitution cypher with an unknown key

Select mode: 3

Select key: 

Message is inputed in input.txt and outputed to output.txt



NOTES
    -When selecting mode, key, and letter frequency, input these 1 space after the colon.
    -Ensure key is correct for mode selected, if not this will cause odd behaviour.
    -Key must be [0,25] for modes 1-2 and 26 different letters for modes 4-5
    -Key does not need to be inputed for mode 3 and 6.
    -In input.txt, message can start anywhere, but if on a new line, this will be copied to output
    -In output.txt, message from input.txt is printed, and resulting message is printed, other information is also printed and this is described when it occurs.
    -The dictionary of words is stored in list.txt
    -In mode 6, if letters have the same frequency they can sometimes be swapped, will sometimes cause some letters to be wrong in final message. To fix this swap the offending letters in the array actfreq on line: siaudofghiusdfhgiusdfhgiusdhfgiusdhfgiushdfgiuhshdfgiusdfigojsdfgoijsdfgoijsdfoigjsdoifggffffgggggoidfsjgoisdfjgoidfjoigsfdjofjidgsiojdfgsdgfogdfsodsgfoijfdgoijgfdsiojdgfiojdfgsiojgfdsiojgfdsoijdgfsiojfdsgijofdgsiojdgfsiojdfsgiojdgfsijodfgsjiodfsgjoidfgiojsjoidfgsiojdgsfiojdgfsijodfgsjoissdoifgjsoidfjgoisdjfgoisjdfgoijsdfhoihsdfhoijdfshiojhfdsoijfdhsiojhdfoijhfoijhdfsoidfhsoijdfhjoidhfsojidfhsoijdfhsijofdhsoijfdhsiodfshoisdfgoijsdoifjgsoidfjgosidfjgsoidfjgoisdfjgjknbxcvibuherioutjhwqeirouyuirfnviuhadswrtiuhjgbigmnoisdurjiepowjuhygmnbgfoikjhpjdsmnaotrifgyhbpnjfuiojhi
