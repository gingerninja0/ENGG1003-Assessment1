Sometimes, reading may seem simple, while at other times, the written word may seem difficult to understand. Reading involves a complex process that involves visual, neurological, and cognitive functions. Breaking down the reading process may help many students improve their reading skill and speed, as well as comprehension of materials. This article is going to focus on the various components of reading that relates to three areas: decoding, comprehension, and retention of the written word. From words, to sentences, to paragraphs, to pages, reading is a gradual process that is built upon, one brick or word at a time. Let's start with the most basic part of the reading process, called decoding. This is not a mysterious or scientific method, but a term that is given to the process of absorbing information. For example, children and adults who learn to read in any language must first begin with the basic elements of that language. For example, the sounds of an alphabet are joined together to form words, or vocabulary. From there, words are connected to form sentences, which may then be connected to form paragraphs.
